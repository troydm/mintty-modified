mintty-modified
================

this is a mintty patch that remaps 
some keys the same way as my putty-modified project:
    
    ctrl+tab and ctrl+shift+tab keys correclty mapped
    alt+shift+arrows keys correctly mapped

other keys are already correctly mapped so it's a tiny patch

install
-------

apply the patch to mintty source code (grab from svn) or 
download already compiled version from Downloads
